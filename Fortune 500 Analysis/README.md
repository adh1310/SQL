This project was focused on more advanced SQL basics, such as using logical operators (AND, OR), the HAVING clause, CASE statements, as well as others. This project was also less guided and 
required me to understand what data was included in the table and come up with questions I could ask regarding it.

See the [data_used](data_used) file for the dataset that was used and the [queries](queries) file for the queries that were ran against it.
